# Predicting-Depression-in-Florida-and-Puerto-Rico
Using SimplyAnalytics' data by US county, I use a variety of machine learning methods to estimate rates of depression of counties in Florida and Puerto Rico, where they have not been recorded. I draw from statistics on crime rates, health conditions, basic demographics, and more in my analysis, and use multiple classification methods, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and random forest classifying. Future directions for this project include hyperparamater tuning to create more accurate predictions and follow-up analyses to highlight why differeences in predicted depression rates occur.

In order to view my vizualisations, please download and open the .html file. To reproduce my code, please use my Jupyter notebook. Data for all of my variables can be found on SimplyAnalytics, utilizing the variables outlined in the codebook I've included in this repository.
