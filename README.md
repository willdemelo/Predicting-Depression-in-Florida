# Predicting-Depression-in-Florida
Using SimplyAnalytics' data by US county, I use a variety of machine learning methods to estimate rates of depression of counties in Florida, where they have not been recorded. I draw from statistics on crime rates, health conditions, basic demographics, and more in my analysis, and use multiple classification methods, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and random forest classifying.

Currently, the interactive linear regression plot is not viewable through .html format. I am currently looking for a solution to this problem.

To reproduce my code, please use my Jupyter notebook. Data for all of my variables can be found on SimplyAnalytics, utilizing the variables outlined in the codebook I've included in this repository.
